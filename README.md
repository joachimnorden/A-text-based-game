[View the live project here.](https://joachimnorden.github.io/A-text-based-game/)


This is a text-based game made with simple Javascript, CSS and HTML. Users can select only one option. If you select wrong option you loose and have to restart the story.

If you choose the right option the game continues until you lose or win. Good luck :)

## User Experience (UX)


-   ### User stories


    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        - I want it to be easy to start the game and begin my journey.




-   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme

        -   The grey background is meant to set the mood and make the text pop a bit more since it's a text-based game. The main colors used is blue and pink. Pink is for the main CTA that stands out from the rest. The blue is for the game options and the icon.

    -   #### Typography

        -   The Readex Pro is the main font for this application with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. I felt like the Readex Pro had some playfulness that fit the game well and it is always used with Bold to make it stand out from the background. 
        

    -   #### Imagery

        -   The imagery is there to create a uniqueness on the start screen. But I didn't want it to distract the text when playing the game so it's not used inside the game itself.

## Features


-   It's made with mobile usage in mind. But it works well on all devices.

### Startscreen

<h2 align="left"><img src="assets/images/startscreen-live.png" width="210"></h2>

-   There to create some uniqueness to the game and to easily start the game with a big CTA.

### Gamescreen

<h2 align="left"><img src="assets/images/gamescreen-live.png" width="210"></h2>

-   As a text-based game I wanted to keep it simple. A white text on a dark background to really keep focus on the text itself and big clear button with a 3D-effect that wants to be clicked. 


## Features to be added

-   A longer and updated story is in the making

-   A clicktracker to compete with friends and family who is the fastest.

-   Make the inventory visible in the gamescreen
